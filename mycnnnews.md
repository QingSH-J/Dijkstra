            Six people have been arrested in last year’s multimillion-dollar gold heist at Toronto’s Pearson International Airport, police in Canada and the US said Wednesday.
    
            Police have also issued arrest warrants for three others in what they described as an “inside job.” All nine suspects have been charged with over 19 counts.
    
            On April 17, 2023, an air cargo container carrying more than 22 million Canadian dollars’ worth of gold bars and foreign currency was stolen from a secure storage facility using fake paperwork, police say. The gold and currency had just arrived on an Air Canada flight from Zurich, Switzerland.
    
            At least two former Air Canada employees allegedly helped in the audacious theft, police say. One is now in custody and an arrest warrant has been issued for the other.
    
            “They needed people inside Air Canada to facilitate this theft,” Detective Sgt. Mike Mavity of Peel Regional Police said, adding that in his opinion, this was an “inside job.”
    
            “We thank the police for their diligent efforts in investigating this matter. As this is now before the courts, we are limited in our ability to comment further. However, we can confirm, as stated by police, that two of the individuals identified did work for Air Canada in the cargo division at the time of the incident. One left the company prior to the arrests announced today and the second has been suspended,” Peter Fitzpatrick, a spokesperson for Air Canada, said in a statement.
    
            The investigation, dubbed “Project 24Karat,” involved the Pennsylvania division of the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
    
            The ATF says a Canadian man arrested in Pennsylvania on traffic violations in September 2023 was the driver of the truck that stole the cargo container. The man was in the US illegally and fled on foot during a traffic stop after a state trooper found firearms in his rental car, it said.
    
            “A court-authorized search warrant for the vehicle led to the recovery of those firearms that were allegedly destined to be smuggled into Canada,” said Eric DeGree, an ATF special agent who spoke at the Peel Regional Police news conference, adding that 65 firearms were prevented from “being used in any number of violent crimes.”

            Police allege the sophisticated organized crime ring planned to use most of the gold and cash to traffic firearms into Canada.
    
            “We believe that they’ve melted down the gold and the profits they got from the gold they used to help finance the firearms, obviously purchasing the illegal firearms,” said Mavity, adding, “We believe that’s how the gold and money has now kind of worked into the firearms trafficking aspect of the investigation”.
    
            Canadian and US officials say the investigation is ongoing and only a fraction of the stolen gold bars and cash has been recovered. Police say after executing a search warrant in Ontario, they found five crudely melted gold bangles worth about $90,000.
    
            “This was the largest gold heist in Canadian history, reportedly, it’s the sixth largest in world crime history,” said Deputy Police Chief Nick Milinovich.
    
            “I don’t think I ever imagined they’d have to deal with the largest gold heist in Canadian history, it’s almost out of an Ocean’s Eleven movie or a CSI. But these criminals thought they were more sophisticated than police, they were wrong,” said Patrick Brown, mayor of Brampton, Ontario.

            Dengue cases are surging in the Americas, with cases reported topping 5.2 million as of this week, surpassing a yearly record set in 2023, according to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).
    
            PAHO spokesperson Ashley Baldwin told CNN Thursday that 5,214,480 cases of dengue have been reported in the Americas as of Wednesday. In all of 2023, the total number of cases reported in the region was 4,572,765.
    
            “We are in an emergency situation because of dengue,” PAHO Director Jarbas Barbosa said in a news briefing Thursday.
    
            Countries in the southern hemisphere have been the hardest hit so far, with Brazil accounting for a majority of the cases. In February, Rio de Janeiro declared a state of public health emergency amid a spike in cases.
    Argentina is battling the worst outbreak of Dengue in its history. But it is not alone. Puerto Rico, Brazil, Paraguay, and Peru are also facing outbreaks and climate change could be behind it. Stefano Pozzebon has the story from Buenos Aires.

            In Peru, 20 of the country’s 25 region are under a health alert due to the epidemic, which has surged to more than 155,000 cases, the government said this week. 146 people have died.
    
            The situation appears to have stabilized in recent weeks in some South American hotspots, but PAHO warned that other countries in the region, including those in the northern hemisphere, must prepare for the arrival of spring and warmer temperatures.
    
            “Most cases in the southern hemisphere occur in the first half of the year, and most cases in the northern hemisphere occur in the second half of the year,” Baldwin said. “So far, this year, we have seen cases peak in the south, and we would now expect an increase in cases in the north.”
    
            The rise of dengue can be attributed to several factors, PAHO says, including rising temperatures, extreme weather events, rapid population growth, and inadequate water and sanitation services, which can create mosquito breeding sites.
    
            So far in 2024, the Americas have reported 1,858 deaths from the illness, less than last year’s total of 2,418.
    
            A vaccine for dengue is available and can play a role in reducing severe cases and deaths, Barbosa said, but he warned it is not capable of immediately interrupting outbreaks.
    
            Dengue is a mosquito-borne virus that is spread mainly through the Aedes aegypti mosquito, also known to carry several other viruses, such as yellow fever, chikungunya, and Zika, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It causes flu-like symptoms and can lead to death in extreme cases.
    
            In Peru, the outbreak has overwhelmed hospitals, including Lima’s Hospital Sergio Bernales, which has already treated more than 2,000 patients for dengue this year. In 2023, it treated just over 900, according to Dr. Óscar Torre, head of the hospital’s internal medicine department, speaking to CNN en Español.
    
            Patients in the facility are receiving care in a special ward built during the Covid-19 pandemic. Many are resting in beds surrounded by netting to keep away mosquitoes, which can carry the virus that causes the illness, video from CNN en Español showed.
    
            To try to control the outbreak, PAHO recommends implementing a strategy that focuses on surveillance, control of the mosquito vector that transmits the virus and clinical management, Baldwin said.
    
            “While there is currently no specific treatment for dengue (at any clinical stage), most cases are mild. Early detection and access to proper medical care will reduce the probability of dying due to severe dengue,” Baldwin added.
    
            The virus is endemic in more than 100 countries in tropical and subtropical climates, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas, according to the World Health Organization. It’s also endemic in the US territories of Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands and American Samoa.
